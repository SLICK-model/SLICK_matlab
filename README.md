A graphical summary of the stochastic low-dimensional inflated convolutional Koopman (SLICK) model is shown. It has the following steps: 
* Collecting data as equally sampled snapshots
* Performing model-order reduction and Fourier convolution
* Training the SLICK model.

The turbulent open cavity flow is demonstrated as an example. 
While the model encompasses complex concepts, it can be formulated using a simple discrete-time algorithm.
